# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe using python. 

This is a very simple tic tac toe game where two people play against each other. We chose this game becasue it tests our understanding with lists, for loops, and while loops. One the game is initialized the players get to choose there name and symbol. From there, the players play a game until one of them win or until there are no more moves. Once that happens, the players are asked if they want to play again and if they want to change there symbols.
